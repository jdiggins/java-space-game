## Details
Star Rats uses Java FX's Timeline to create a simple game loop. All graphics are rendered using a Canvas, so the graphics are redrawn each frame. All of the games objects are kept track of using the Handler class, which calls the update function to update the position and state of every game object during each iteration of the game loop.
